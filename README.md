# Pomodoro Clock

This project is a web based clock, useful for the Pomodoro productivity technique.

### The Pomodoro Technique
Break up your worktime into 25 minute intervals ("pomodoro"), separated by 5 minute break intervals ("short break"). During each pomodoro, you work for 25 minutes without distractions, and during each break you step away from your work. After four or so "pomodoros", instead of taking a "short break," take a "long break," which can vary from 10 to 20 minutes depending on the method; this project uses 10 minutes for its "long break."
